Netflix clone using React for practice

Most of the intial code in this project is done by following a tutorial on youtube by Clever Programmer. Go to the below link if you want to do this on your own and with all the explantion on what's on going.

Step 1: To run this project you need have node and npm intalled in your computer. Go to the below link and download the executable file once done run the file and it should automatically setup most of the stuff you need to run this project.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Step 2: Once you have downloaded and run the node exe file check whether it is intalled in your system or not. Type in the commands "node -v" and "npm" in your terminal or command propmt to verify. If you don't see any info then most likely the environment variables are not properly set, which you can do manually.

Step 3: Now once you have node and npm installed to run this project first you need to install node modules which will have all the packages that are needed or used in this project. The command is "npm install" or "npm i"

(Note: If you are getting any new changes from git it is better to run it again especially when you see any updates in package.json to install any updates to existing packages or to download new packages that are specified.)

Step 4: Now to run the project locally you just type in the command "npm start" which will make this project run in your localhost: 3000 or another port if this one is busy, which you will able to see in the terminal. Go to the browser and open the localhost to see the magic. (Caution note: IE might not be the best browser to see the changes since i didn't include support for it and the reason for this is IE doesn't support ES6 syntax which I have used.)

Additional info: I do have some files that are setup for deploying this with the help of firebase, so feel free to remove those and add you own configurations in case you want to deploy as well.
